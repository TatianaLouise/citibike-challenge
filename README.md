Citbike Stations by User Type and Popularity Throughout the
Seasons (July 2023 vs. January 2024)

An analysis of the Citibike trends occurring in Jersey City in July 2023 versus the
January 2024 phenomenon between casual riders and those with Citibike memberships. The data
sources from July 2023 and January 2024 were combined to create over 150,000 entries that
describe the rider type, ride ID, classic bike vs. electric bike, station names and IDs, as well as
start latitude and longitude and end latitude and longitude.

Member Dashboard
The member dashboard presents a map that shows the Citibike stations by user type
popularity and demonstrates the differences between July 2023 (mid-summer) and January 2024
(mid-winter). The map can be filtered by month and by day, with the circle size showing the
most popular stations by day during the summer when there are more tourists, versus the winter
when there are fewer tourists.
The bar charts indicate that the total trips taken in the summer are significantly more than
the amount taken in the winter possibly due to weather conditions and a slow tourist season, with
a 41.72% decrease in member users in January 2024 and a decrease of 76.20% in casual riders.
These charts can be filtered by day and month to see which days are busier than others.

Storyboard
The storyboard includes the member dashboard along with other insights into the
seasonal differences. The line graph indicates that, in the summer, members use more Citibikes
on Mondays and Wednesdays, possibly due to increased commutes to the office, as those are the
days when most people go in. For member riders, there is a 25.23% decrease in usage between
Monday and Tuesday, which correlates to the number of people who normally go into the office
on those days. It increases again on Thursday by around 17% and begins to taper down
throughout the weekend. This is the opposite for casual riders, who use the Citibikes at an
increasing rate of more than 57% Thursday through Saturday. As for the winter months, usage is
cut in half for casual riders, while members primarily use the bikes on Wednesdays more than
any other day of the week, with a dramatic drop to a little over 3,000 users on the weekends.
The most popular stations by day for each of the two seasons can also be seen in the
bubble chart in addition to the preferred bike type by rider in the pie chart. These can both be
filtered by month (season) and day.

Results
The results of this analysis indicate that Citibike might want to reallocate financial
resources into bike repairs, marketing, and station upkeep during the winter months while there
is less usage and prepare for the summer peak. The filters can be used to determine which days
and which stations have fewer users, in other words, the optimal days for bike and station repairs
and maintenance before the summer peak.
